Dear C Enthusiast:

This diskette is a beta-test copy of the Numerical Recipes in C diskette,
designed to accompany our forthcoming book NUMERICAL RECIPES IN C, to
be published in Spring, 1988, by Cambridge University Press.  We are
sending this to you free, and with no obligation, but also without warranty
of any kind.  We would appreciate getting your feedback.

Most of you have written us as readers of the existing NUMERICAL RECIPES
book, which contains programs in FORTRAN and Pascal.  You will find that
the C programs on this disk are algorithmically close to their siblings
in the other languages.  You should be able to use the existing book to
get started with these C versions.  Eventually, you will probably want
to get a copy of the C book, since it details the occasional language-
specific differences and contains some useful appendices.

If by any chance you do not already have a copy of NUMERICAL RECIPES,
and you want to use this diskette effectively, you will probably have to
get a hold of one.  Since, ultimately, you will want to get NUMERICAL 
RECIPES IN C, rather than the current NUMERICAL RECIPES, we recommend that
you try to find a copy of the current version in your local library, or
borrow one from a friend.  If all else fails, you can buy a copy from
Cambridge University Press (800-431-1580 or 914-235-0300).  Who knows,
perhaps it will teach you to like FORTRAN!

NUMERICAL RECIPES IN C will have a twenty page discussion of programming
conventions for scientific programming in C.  Among the matters discussed
is that of allocating vectors and matrices in C, not necessarily with
a range of indices starting with zero.  Our view is that some algorithms
"naturally" go from 1 to N, not from 0 to N-1.  For this reason, we
provide on this disk a set of utility routines NRUTIL.C, for allocating
and deallocating vectors and matrices with arbitrary index ranges.  These
are used extensively in the Recipes on this disk.  You will need to
figure them out (unfortunately without the aid of the book for now) in
order to use this disk effectively.

Here is an example of creating, and then using, a matrix with row
index running from 1 to 13, and with column index running from 1 to 9:

	#include "nrutil.c"   /* or, just declare float **matrix(); */
	float **a;
	a=matrix(1,13,1,9);
	...
	a[3][5]=...
	...+a[2][9]/3.0...
	someroutine(a,...);
	...
	free_matrix(a,1,13,1,9);

Notice that we ALWAYS use a pointer-to-array-of-pointers-to-rows structure
for matrices, NEVER a fixed dimension structure like "float a[13][9]".
There are a number of advantages to this described in the book.  One
key advantage is that the Recipes do not need to know the physical dimensions
of matrices that are passed to them.

Here is an example of how to convert a fixed dimension matrix to a
pointer-to-array-of-pointers structure:

	float a[13][9],**aa;
	int i;
	aa=(float **) malloc((unsigned) 13*sizeof(float*));
	for(i=0;i<=12;i++) aa[i]=a[i];

You then pass the pointer aa to any Numerical Recipe.  Note, however,
that the row index varies from 0 to 12, not 1 to 13.  Since many
recipes expect the latter choice, it is better to use the utility
matrix() as shown above.

The file NR.H is a header file for all the Recipes.  The file
COMPLEX.C contains utilities that are used by a few Recipes for complex
arithmetic.

We have included a small selection of driver programs from the NUMERICAL
RECIPES EXAMPLE BOOK (C), just to show how some of the Recipes are
used.  These driver routines are in the alpha-test form, and they may
undergo considerable change before they are released.  Use them with
caution.

Good luck!  And let us hear from you.

Sincerely,

NUMERICAL RECIPES SOFTWARE
